              There is not a single point of uncertainty that we are living in
              the era of Entertainment and Information. Hollywood is the source
              of entertainment.
            </p>

            <p>
              Is it possible for anyone to predict something in this crazy
              industry? We have also asked the same question to many of my
              friends and colleagues.
            </p>
            <p>
              The obvious answer we have got mostly is 'Yes, Of course there
              will be someone.' but they weren't able to explain on what certain
              concrete factors they do feel that.
            </p>

            <p>
              Have you ever watched a movie you liked and thought about the
              different factors that make it successful? This visualization is
              an attempt to explore Hollywood Industry. Lets see how the course
              of movies has changed over the course of years.
            </p>

            <p>
              The below graph represents the number of movies that were made
              over the course of last 100 years. As you can see, there is an
              exponential growth in the number of movies made during the
              1990-2000.
            </p>
            <svg id="containerYearMovieCount" width="700" height="500">
              <g
                id="bodyyearmoviecount"
                style="transform:translate(50px, 50px)"
              ></g>
            </svg>

            <!-- <svg id="linechart" width="760" height="500"></svg> -->
            
            <p>
              The number of movies being produced were affected greatly due to
              wars. Before 1950, US was involved in the World War 1 and World
              War 2. And the era between 1947 and 1991 was the era of Cold war.
            </p>

            <p>
              After the termination of war, people were attracted towards
              entertainment for distraction. This lead to a sudden demand for
              movies and as a result the number of movies made during that
              decade increased exponentially. And as observed, the count of
              movies hasn't gone down after that.
            </p>

            <p>
              This graphs represents difference in the number of movies that
              have been made based on popular genre category. As seen in this
              graph, maximum movies made were comedic.
            </p>
            <svg id="containerAll">
              <g id="bodyGenre" style="transform:translate(50px, 0px)"></g>
              <g id="xAxis1"></g>
              <g id="yAxis1"></g>
            </svg>

            <p>

            After observing the above graph, the eminent question comes to your mind will be is comedic films are this much? We tend to
            focus towards Drama, Action and Sci-fi that we don't presume to put much consideration to comedic genre. But the reality is
            that it is an essential.
            </p>

            <p>
              While talking about the genres and their evolution, let's dive deep into the all around the globe movie industry and find the
              trends, popularity and evolution of the Cinematic Universe. It would be interesting to see whether it surpasses your imagination,
              expectations, and intutions.

              Pretty cool, isn't it? Looks like the Cinema industry is not going down in near future under any condition. Do you agree?
            </p>
            <p>
              Now lets analyze how people have received the movies that have
              been released. There is a peak between the range 6 and 8 stating
              that most of the movies that are released are average. The descend
              after 8 shows that very few movies are made that are exceptional.

            </svg>

            <p>
              This was all the analysis that was done on the movie data set as a
              whole. But how can we determine if a movie is successful? We have
              defined the success of the movies based on the gross box office
              and awards won.
            </p>

            <h2 class="section-heading">The Academy Awards</h2>

            <p>
              To recognize the excellence in cinematic achievements, the Academy
              Awards, also widely known as Oscars was introduced in 1929. This
              award ceremony is widely accepted and a major inspiration to all
              the people working in the movie industry. It was observed that the
              movies that win an Oscar are bound to be one of the most
              successful movies of all time.
            </p>

            <p>
              However, these days, Oscar winning movies are not always the
              highest grossing movies, sometimes majority of the people are not
              even aware that these movies exist.
            </p>
            <p>
              Take James Cameron's Avatar (2008) for example, it earned more
              than $2 billion worldwide and was an international box office hit.
              Both critics and moviegoers loved the movie. But, the Oscar for
              best picture that year was given to Kathryn Bigelow's Hurt Locker,
              a movie relatively unheard of amongst moviegoers. Today, Hurt
              Locker stands as the lowest grossing best picture winner of all
              time. In 2003, The Lord of the Rings: The Return of the King
              became the rare popcorn event film to achieve mass appeal, earning
              $377 million in its theatrical run, and also emerge with the
              year’s top Oscar honor. This reflects a difference in taste
              between moviegoers and film industry professionals. In the past 30
              years, only four movies were named best picture while topping box
              office charts.

            <p>
              In 2015, “Star Wars: The Force Awakens,” the first live-action
              “Star Wars” movie since 2005, opened with enormous success,
              smashing multiple box office records. The film took in $970
              million domestically, and more than $1 billion internationally.
              But “Spotlight,” which tells the story of a team of investigative
              journalists at The Boston Globe, won best picture. It took in only
              $47 million domestically — less than 5 percent of the revenue of
              the year’s biggest film.

              This graph helps us to analyze how the gross box office of the
              award winning movies have changed. You can view the year when the
              movie was released by hovering over the bar of that movie.
            </p>

            <p>
              Now coming to the data based on last 20 years. Lets see how movies
              have performed on the Box office. The following scatter plot shows
              that almost half of the movies earn a gross value less than $100k.
              The points in orange represent the movies which won the Oscar for
              that year.

              This graph helps you compare the gross box office of the award
              winning movies and others. As you can see that from 1994 - 2003,
              the award winning film were in the top 20 grossing movies, whereas
              after 2004, this hasn't always been the case.

            <blockquote>
              Points to Take Away:<br />
              1. The Academy has shown that it prefers artistic movies which
              have technical innovation, originality or cultural
              significance.<br />
              2. Certain genre(Drama) has more chances of winning the Academy
              award.<br />
              3. The movies that have won an Oscar for Best Picture haven't been
              the highest grossing movies since the past 15 years.
