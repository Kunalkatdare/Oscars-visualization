## About
Did you ever wonder why the movies that are widely appreciated by critics and moviegoers
don’t win an Oscar but some movies that you have never even heard of win them? Is there a
discrepancy with movies that perform well at the Oscars and their performance at the box
office? Take James Cameron's Avatar (2008) for example, it earned more than $2 billion
worldwide and was an international box office hit. Both critics and moviegoers loved the movie.
But, the Oscar for best picture that year was given to Kathryn Bigelow's Hurt Locker, a movie
relatively unheard of amongst moviegoers. Today, Hurt Locker stands as the lowest grossing
best picture winner of all time. In 2003, The Lord of the Rings: The Return of the King became
the rare popcorn event film to achieve mass appeal, earning $377 million in its theatrical run,
and also emerge with the year’s top Oscar honor. This reflects a difference in taste between
moviegoers and film industry professionals. In the past 30 years, only four movies were named
best picture while topping box office charts. Let's see if this is true or just our random deductions using information visualization.
